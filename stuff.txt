Wires
-----

How to check if two things are connected:

- If both things are connected to a wire, and that wire has the same ID, they are connected
- When a wire component is removed, recalculate all new IDs for all wire components with the current ID (expensive?)

Power Node
----------

Options: Output Voltage (Default: 6v)
Inputs: on/off (can be set manually if not wired in)
Output: Power

Ground Node
-----------

Options: None
Inputs: Power
Output: None

Notes: If connected to a power node, draws 100% of current from the node (essentially if any power node is connected to a ground node, nullify the output of the power node)

Binary Input Field
------------------

Take a string of binary digits (1 or 0) and send it as input

T Splitter
----------

Split 1 input into 2 outputs

X Splitter
----------

Split 1 input into 3 outputs
